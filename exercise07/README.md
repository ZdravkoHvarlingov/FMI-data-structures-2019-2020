### What are we going to talk about today?
1. Binary search tree - how it works, implementation using OOP;

### Task descriptions
1. Implement the binary search tree with tree methods
   -    add
   -    delete
   -    search for an element

2. You are given N numbers(let them be a lot >= 100) and after that M search numbers. For each of the M numbers you have to find if they are present in the first N numbers. Implement that in two ways:
    -   Make binary search tree and insert all of the N numbers, after that search for each of the M ones;
    -   For each of the M numbers just pass linear through the first N numbers;
    -   Compare both approaches, you can measure the time needed for the program to execute;
    -   Example, N = 5 [10, 11, 3, 24, 5], M = 3 [3, 123, 2], so we have: 3 - YES, 123 - NO, 2 - NO

3. Try to insert numbers in increasing order inside a binary search tree, what will be the result? Will you have good seach time?

4. You have sequence of N numbers. Try to sort them using binary search tree.
