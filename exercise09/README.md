### What are we going to talk about today?
1. Prefix tree - overview and idea
2. Complete and full(proper) trees
3. Heaps, heap sort - implementation within OOP
   - push operation
   - pop operation
   - make a heap from an array


### Task descriptions
1. Implement a heap tree
2. Sort an array using a heap tree(heep sort) - the fastest sort we know so far
3. Having an array of N elements, get the K largest elements from it.
4. Dynamic median - you have to implement a data structure which has the following operations:
    -   Insert an element into it(O(logn))
    -   Get the median of the elements so far(O(1))
5. Make a prefix tree(trie).
   -    implement a function which pushes a string inside the tree;
   -    implement a function which gets the number of words inside the tree;
   -    implement a function which returns all the words with a certain prefix inside the tree;
   -    *implement word delete operation;
