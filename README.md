FMI data structures
Question to discuss:
Rely on lectures and solve as many tasks as possible or pass throught the theory again?

Course plan:
1. Exercise 1, 07.10.2019 - Intro, queue, stacks
2. Exercise 2, 14.10.2019 - Linked list, implementation of queue and stack using linked list(the efficient approach)
3. Exercise 3, 21.10.2019 - Sorting, slow algorithms - selection, buble, insertion, implementation
4. Exercise 4, 28.10.2019 - Non linear data structures, binary tree, implementation, how it works, in order traversal, post order traversal, pre order traversal(DFS for a tree)
5. Exercise 5, 04.11.2019 - Expression trees
6. Exercise 6, 11.11.2019 - Iterators, iterator pattern, what is the idea, simple data structures iterators(queue, stack, linked list)
7. Exercise 7, 18.11.2019 - Binary search tree
8. SKIP because of university celebration, 25.11.2019
9. Exercise 8, 02.12.2019 - Test look through and tips, move semantics, BFS on a tree
10. SKIP because of December 8th, 09.12.2019
11. Exercise 9, 16.12.2019 - Non binary trees, trie prefix tree, complete and full trees, heap, heap sort
12. SKIP because of Christmas, 23.12.2019
13. SKIP because of New yer, 30.12.2019
14. Exercise 10, 06.01.2020 - key-value data structures - implementations with hash functions, hash tables and with binary search tree
15. Exercise 11, 13.01.2020 - Graphs, adjacency matrix vs adjacency representations, DFS and BFS
