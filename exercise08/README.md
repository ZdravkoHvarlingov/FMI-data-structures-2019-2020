### What are we going to talk about today?
1. BFS on a tree(level traversal);
2. Test look through and tips
3. Move semantics


### Task descriptions
1. Implement a function which iterates the tree line by line from left to right. Check if the node values are ordered in increasing order.
2. Implement a function which returns a vector of all the sums per level in a given tree.
3. We call a tree a happy one if the first element is equal to the the last element in every level. Also on every level the last element should be the same as the first element on the next level. Implement a function which check if the tree is happy or not.
