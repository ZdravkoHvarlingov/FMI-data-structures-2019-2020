### What are we going to talk about today?
1. BFS on a tree(level traversal);
2. Recursive traversals to iterative ones - preorder vs inorder and postorder;
3. Non binary trees, prefix tree;


### Task descriptions
1. Implement a function which iterates the tree line by line from left to right. Check if the node values are ordered in increasing order.
2. Implement a function which returns a vector of all the sums per level in a given tree.
3. We call a tree a happy one if the first element is equal to the the last element in every level. Also on every level the last element should be the same as the first element on the next level. Implement a function which check if the tree is happy or not.
4. Make a prefix tree(trie).
   -    implement a function which pushes a string inside the tree;
   -    implement a function which gets the number of words inside the tree;
   -    implement a function which returns all the words with a certain prefix inside the tree;
   -    *implement word delete operation
