### What are we going to talk about today?
1. Sorting and why do we need it?
   - order in nearest shop, restourant
   - find the cheepest flight, hotel
   - search in unordered set of thing?!
2. Naive approaches: selection sort, buble sort, insertion sort


### Task descriptions - sorting should be used in each of the tasks
1. Implement selection sort, buble sort, insertion sort;
2. Count the number of swaps(movement of elements) in each of the algorithms, compare them;
3. Given a list of numbers, find the number of occurences of each element:
   -    [1, -1, 2, 1, 10] -> -1: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 10: 1
4. Given a list of numbers, construct another list which does not contain duplicates;
5. Given two lists of numbers, check if they are completely the same;
6. Given a list of sorted numbers, check if there are two numbers A and B which has sum equal to C(A + B = C). You receive C as an argument;
